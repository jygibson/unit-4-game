This is homework assignment #4 for my coding class. The assignment is to create a game where the four images have mystery values, and you click on them to reach a goal value. if you reach the value, you win. If you go over the value, you lose. 

It will combine html, css, javascript, and jQuery.

First, I will psuedocode the game to figure out what I need to do, including the steps and variable.

Second, I will write the html for what information is needed on the page, including game instructions, and the score.

Third, I will create the javascript and jQuery specifically looking back upon the crystal-game in class activity. also got ideas, such as the image array, from the slideshow activity in class on 5.2 (I think?)

Fourth, once it works, I will go back and make it prettier using css.

Fifth, link to my portfolio site
